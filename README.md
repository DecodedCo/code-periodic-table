Periodic table of HTML 5 elements
=================================

Full credit to Josh Duck for originally creating the HTML 5 periodic table of elements. 

I'm not sure why Josh removed his version from his website. I thought it was useful, so this is my recreation of it.

This version is made with css only, so modern browsers please.

## Decoded additions:

* Decoded have added a server side script in golang and in php so that websites can be searched.
* There is also a heatmap feature added by amlwwalker so that you can see which elements are used most frequently. Try the examples...

* Css could be cleaned up...
